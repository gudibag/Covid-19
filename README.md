## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the world, affecting millions of people and various aspects of daily life. This project aims to analyze and visualize the COVID-19 data to gain insights into the spread and impact of the virus. By utilizing data visualization techniques, we can effectively communicate complex information and trends to facilitate better understanding.

## Tools

The tools used in this project are as follows:
1. Google Big query
2. BigQuerySQL
3. Tableau
4. Google docs

## Data Set

The data set used for this analysis was sourced from Our World in Data website (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). Our World in Data provides a comprehensive and reliable collection of COVID-19 data from various sources worldwide. The dataset includes information such as daily confirmed cases, deaths, testing, vaccination, and other relevant metrics.

## Challenges Faced

During the course of this analysis, several challenges were encountered. Some of the key challenges include:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The raw data required thorough cleaning and preprocessing to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. This step was crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the visualizations.

2. **Data Integration**: Integrating different data sources and formats posed a challenge in creating a unified dataset for analysis. Careful merging and matching of data were necessary to maintain consistency across different variables.

3. **Visual Design**: Designing effective and informative visualizations that accurately represent the data while being visually appealing and easy to interpret was another challenge. Choosing the appropriate chart types, color schemes, and layouts required careful consideration.

4. **Interactivity**: Implementing interactive features to enhance user engagement and exploration of the data was a challenge. Incorporating interactive elements such as tooltips, filters, and zoom functionalities required additional coding and attention to user experience.

## Summary

In this analysis, we explored the COVID-19 data sourced from Our World in Data and visualized various aspects of the pandemic. We examined the trends in confirmed cases, deaths, testing, and vaccination rates over time and across different regions. The visualizations provided a comprehensive overview of the impact of the virus and allowed us to identify patterns, hotspots, and potential correlations.

We also investigated the effectiveness of different public health measures implemented by countries to control the spread of the virus. By comparing the data from countries with varying strategies, we gained insights into the effectiveness of measures such as lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccination campaigns.

## Conclusion

Through this data visualization analysis, we aimed to provide a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. The visualizations presented in this project help visualize the trends, patterns, and key metrics related to the virus. By analyzing the data, we can make informed decisions and recommendations to combat the spread of the virus and mitigate its impact on public health.

The COVID-19 data set sourced from Our World in Data provided a reliable and comprehensive resource for conducting this analysis. However, it is important to note that the analysis presented here is based on the available data and assumptions made during the process. Further research and analysis are necessary to gain a more nuanced and complete understanding of the pandemic.
